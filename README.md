# Rusty


## Why?ðŸ’­

This is a learning experience for anyone...coding is not my background but I'm looking to start off with Rust as it is something that others that I know around me are learning and I want to try my hand at it. Rust learning has been interesting so far and I've learn a few things. I will start commneting a majority of this code that I add the to repo, mainly because it's a good practice, but I tend to take breaks and I need refreshers for when I come back to it. 

Short - Term Goals:
1. Create mini projects
2. Learn how to integrate them and sign software

Long-Term Goals: 
1. Create agents for a C2
2. Create a C2 for learning purposes and eventually a management dashboard


## What? ðŸ’­ðŸ“•ðŸ’³

The thought is that someone that can create apps and services that become useful to a company will be able to write their own paycheck. The ideal situation is to start learning and then branch out to offering skills for hire in the near future. I'm goning to start with the TCM training that is free on YouTube and move into the paid training on their Academy shortly afterwards.

## When? ðŸ•¢ 

I'm looking to work on this every Tuesday and Thursday Nights. I will take a lesson or work on an app those days. Possibly, considering a stream on Twitch, YouTbue, etc. We'll see though.
